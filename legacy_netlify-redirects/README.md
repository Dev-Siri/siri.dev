## Whats this?

This is just a temporary deployment for netlify to redirect stuff to the new website hosted on vercel.

Yep, I'm changing my mind about the commit message "netlify > vercel"
since astro 3, I've been tempted to migrate. So I'm finally doing it.

This will be lying around here for sometimes, a few months atleast, before google finally updates all urls to the new domain, and I can finally remove this dir.
