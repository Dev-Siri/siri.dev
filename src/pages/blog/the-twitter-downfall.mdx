Twitter? right. I already spend a lot of my time there. Now, I know many people hate the platform already, and I can't blame anyone. It can be a cesspool at times. But to me, who is part of the "Tech Twitter" community, its actually pretty ok there. Still not fully "peaceful" there, **\*cough \*\*** react **\*cough** server components **\*\*cough\*\*\***, but still bearable.

## Before I start trashing on the platform and Elon

If any of you Elon fans are already hating on me because I'm calling Elon "trash" or the Platform "Twitter", then press `Ctrl + W` and get the hell out of my website. Well, if you are even more offended and want to just tweet this out to your verified Elon Simp gang to come after me, here is my Twitter: <SocialMediaLink username="@DevSiriTweets" variant="twitter">Dev-Siri</SocialMediaLink>, go on, do it. I wanna see how many people still haven't figured out life.

## Super Apps

Well since Elon's take over, it seems like the platform is getting worse and worse. Most of it can be blamed on the super app concept that Elon is pushing towards. Now look, I'm not saying super apps are necessarily bad. They _can_ be convenient. But the problem is, they don't work for everyone. Elon said he wants "the WeChat for the west". This guy thinks a concept that has already been tried many times in the past, and failed, is possible because HE is doing it. Because lets be real here, WeChat is just a giant surveillance tool for the Chinese government. The rest of the world is much more open than that. <br /> <br />

A super app, that can do banking, social media, live streaming, messaging, and more just sounds like a huge privacy concern. Why the hell would I want to use one app that provides a bunch of sloppy services when I can use apps that are focused on one service and are actually good at it? And yes even though I called it a "convenience" a second ago, I honestly just never thought of it as convenient myself, it was just what most people say about super apps that I pasted here.
In reality, I still see no advantages of a super app. Sure, all your services are in one place, but you still have to click on each service to use them. Doesn't this already sound like opening apps? LEAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING SERVICES TO THE OS. MAKE APPS THAT DO ONE OR TWO THINGS CORRECTLY. I.e Super apps just sounds like an OS inside an OS. Why would I want that? If I REALLY want to make things convenient, then I'd put every single app on my phone on the home screen so I can access them with one click. + Using individual apps gives me the advantages of the OS's built-in multitasking capabilities like the Recent/Background Apps for example.

## Obsession with X

X is a letter that is associated with negativity, danger, or other not good things. But when used correctly, can look cool.
No I'm not talking about Xx-gamer-xX names, those are another level of cringe. Like SpaceX is actually a good name for a space exploration company. But do you what's not a good name? X! Don't even count the exclamation mark, just "X". Especially for a social media company. Do you know what people associate with X? _not good things / negativity_. But what would be even more brain-dead behavior? Making the logo an unicode character that is impossible to trademark. Nobody would want _that_ branding right? .... Except that one man already did, his name is Elon Ma, and he likes to experiment with his "toys". On the 31st of July, 2023, Elon had a sudden thought at 3 AM that he was disappointed at his harmful actions against Twitter didn't kill the bird app yet, so he decided to go back to the 3 staff working at his company and oof the bird altogether. So now Twitter doesn't even exist. <br /> <br />

And literally, this is the worst rebrand so far since the new coke back in the 1980s. To this day, every person I've met either doesn't know Twitter has changed to X, or they don't call it X. Because saying "Can you follow me on X?" is just straight up dumb. I don't call it X, everyone I know doesn't call it X. The only ones who do, are Elon simps, news reporters (even they have to always add "fka Twitter") and Elon himself along with his 3-4 employees still left in his corporation. Seriously, I can't get over this. How does one man love a single letter of an alphabet SO MUCH? Even if I try to, I can't become THIS stupid.

## Feature.... Removals

So that was all just the start. We haven't even gotten into the feature removals. Let me start from the least significant to the most significant.

First up, broadcast text. So you might not even remember this because of how overlooked it was. It was basically a text like "Twitter for Android", "Twitter for iPhone", or "Twitter Web App" which would show from which platform you posted the tweet. Honestly, I really don't care about this much. And I didn't even notice when it was removed. But its removal actually made a very popular thing impossible. So y'all probably know about <SocialMediaLink username="@jacksfilms" variant="youtube">JacksFilms</SocialMediaLink>, and his infamous Twitter for Android trend where he tweeted the same thing (with a bit of twist) everyday in 2019 and at the end of the year compiled them into one music video. Want to recreate it? Well, too bad. You _can_ tweet the same thing everyday but it won't say "Twitter for Android" or something else because that's now done for. <br /> <br />

Second on our hand is the most significant of them all, circles. Now, this feature was actually pretty recently added, just in October 2022, yet it was used by many. The removal of this one feature made many users lose their entire group on Twitter. I cannot understand how "this is a good change". Just because you, Elon, don't use something, doesn't mean everyone does the same. A feature was once added, it has been used by many people, and now prematurely removing it is nothing but stupid. <br /> <br />

The last's the block button, or, was about to? The block button is pretty much required by every social media to have sane users. One man famously disagrees, and that man, is obviously, **ELON**. He got the most attention of a feature removal when it came to the block button, and the attention was obvious to predict. A social media without a block button sounds like hell, its a basic safety feature. But enough pressure was put on him to prevent him from making the decision, and he left the block button alone. But this man's crazy, who knows when he will start going after this one feature again. <br /> <br />

All of these features were actual features that were removed or are endangered to be removed, but the next one was not removed, but instead corrupted to hell.

## Verifications

Verifications **were** the only way before to prove a person was legit. Again that same weirdo dude "business" man / corrupt CEO (same thing) thought it wasn't. So he rolled out Twitter Blue, AKA, how to corrupt a platform 101. And the result was utter chaos. Even after settling it for a few days, its over. The verification is no longer a badge that people flex about anymore nor is it a proper "legit" badge, its just a badge, a very very corrupt one. And then suddenly Elon started verifying accounts that have over 1M followers. And that didn't turn out to be a good idea as well, because of this new "this person paid for twitter pfffffffffffff" meme. Many people claimed THEY DIDN'T PAY, and they were NOT happy with the verification. This just shows how much value this badge has seemingly lost. Now unless this subscription service gets halted, the badge ain't worth it.

## SIMPS

If any of y'all Elon worshipers are still here, this section is dedicated to you. I don't get Elon simps. Why do y'all act like he is some kind of hero when all he does is tweet stolen memes and buy companies he can benefit from to steal the credit. Did you know Elon is NOT the founder/co-founder of Tesla, got kicked out of PayPal because he suggested to name that company X as well, and (as we all know) is actively destroying Twitter?

### "But... he's saving free speech and humanity"

WHAT "FREE SPEECH"? what are you SO PUMPED ABOUT? Converting a platform from a warzone to a warzone w/ hate speech isn't called saving free speech. If he was serious about it, he wouldn't even be ruling the platform. No, the new CEO Linda Yaccarino doesn't count, she is very Elon driven, so this brain chip guy still has his power on the entire platform. <br /> <br />

And be honest with me, when was the last time you thought of "humanity" when you were tweeting out a hot take? If you were thinking about humanity, then you wouldn't even be on the internet. <br /> <br />

Man, I don't even try to understand them, because their tweets are like a roller coaster ride, except the only thing going up is my confusion.

## Ending it

### So what can be the alternatives?

Tbh, I don't think Twitter can be replaced. Plenty of attempts have been seen especially after the Musk takeover. Let's go over some of them.

- **Mastodon** -- This platform is like the Linux of social media apps and a lot of people are already on here. The only problem is, that like Linux, no ordinary person uses this. Even I, a tech person, don't have an account on this platform. For a platform to be accessible, it needs to appeal to every person no matter their tech savviness. On Mastodon, people just get stuck on choosing an instance, and that's the reason most nerds are on the platform.

- **BlueSky** -- Founded by the blue bird app man himself, Jack Dorsey. This app, is questionable. You literally CAN'T use it, unless you have friends (rare), and one of them has an invite that they didn't already give to another person. Then, when you actually manage to enter the app, _make sure_ to turn off the button that says to show nazis as well. But once you do that, theres NO ONE to talk to.

- **Threads** -- **Was** the biggest competitor to Twitter. It was ~~built~~ stolen by Zark Muckerberg (robot man) And, it looked like a promising replacement for Twitter. It imported your friends from Instagram, so no searching like BlueSky + You didn't need to be a nerd and know about servers and instances like Mastodon. But it **was** a competitor. After just a few days, most people literally just left, and went back to their e𝕏. Why? because its simple, Threads's (just like Instagram's) algorithm is meant to make advertisers happy, **NOT PEOPLE**. The hype quickly died down, and now the only thing people talk about on Threads, is that nobody is on Threads. I certainly know that I didn't signup, because I don't HAVE an Instagram, and nor am I going to make one. (I try to stay away from Zuck territory)

**tl;dr**: All the other apps suck replicating Twitter

### Final Words

I am just here to see where this platform is headed. One thing thats a fact at this point is that its simply worse to use Twitter now than it was 2 years ago. I've literally never seen any person defend these changes, except the Elon simps, but they are not people so I am not counting them. The only real prediction I can make is that people will still be trapped on this platform, run by a person who tries to think without a mind, connect without a sign, and live without a life.
