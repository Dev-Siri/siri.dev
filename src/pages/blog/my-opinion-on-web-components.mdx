Web components were on my rader as a native built-in feature that I was interested in using. But after using it,
I have some thoughts on the technology.

Well... lets start with my...

## Experience

Honestly, the experience with Web Components (atleast for me) wasn't that bad. I was using it to add progressive enhancements / small interactivity in my site's guestbook (hey btw check it out at [/guestbook](/guestbook)). But here's the thing, **I was using it all wrong**. Or atleast not the way most people would think.

Here is what I did:

```html
<guestbook-comments class="mt-10 gap-4 flex flex-col">
  <!-- child slot replaced with data fetched -->
  <slot />
</guestbook-comments>

<script>
  import type { GuestBookEntry } from "../utils/guestbook";

  class GuestbookComments extends HTMLElement {
    public async addEntry(newEntry: GuestBookEntry) {
      // ...
    }
  }
</script>
```

You can find the full source file on [GitHub](https://github.com/Dev-Siri/siri.dev/blob/474c1c0288ff4bdb28e9f454cd3dea6a2c805c8a/src/islands/GuestbookComments.astro).

Web components are meant to be like Framework Components (in React for example), where a component itself does everything in a [shadow-root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot). But here is the problem....
Web components don't support SSR, and they also lead to worse SEO. Because they need to be defined with `customElements.define()` which is only
available in the browser `window` object. This means using shadow root as a namespace for creating elements will not render the elements if
JavaScript is disabled. They are client-only, and this is bad for me. I like having stuff working without JavaScript and this just looks like a `useFootGun` 2.0

<br />
What I was doing with web components could be just used as regular `onsubmit` && `onclick` handlers. Yeah, I was kinda using them wrong. I was only doing
that to get stuff like:

```html
<script>
  class AddComment extends HTMLElement {
    public async addComment() {
      // types are funny
      const guestbookComments: (Element & { addData(newEntry: GuestBookEntry): Promise<void> }) | null = document.querySelector("guestbook-comments");

      // its the same method that I had defined before in the wc
      if (guestbookComments) await guestbookComments.addEntry(stuff);
      //                                             ^^^^^^^
    }
  }
</script>
```

Although it was kind of unneccessary, I also liked this approach. Because instead of a JS-Only or HTML-Only component, where one
doesn't show anything without JavaScript and the other doesn't update at all, this combines the best of both in a reusable component.

## What if I actually used it in a real world project?

Will I ever use it in a real-world large app? heck no. But, if I had to, will I write vanilla? NEVER. I have seen the pain of writing
low-level DOM, and therefore its just not worth writing something inferior to just writing a React / Svelte Component. If I ever need Web
Components, I have Svelte! I can just compile it to web components and just use that instead of writing painful vanilla JavaScript.
In fact, its so easy to compile Svelte -> Web Components, I will just show one in 2 lines:

```html
<svelte:options customElement="web-component" />

<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

## Do I think Web Components are good?

#### Yesn't

I just think they can be better. The main issue I have with them is their API & SSR/SEO Limitations. I don't get the trend of making native features
ridiculously difficult to work with. Web Components **don't** need to have such a hard API. Everytime a new feature comes out on the web, its either
too low-level (like WCs) or too limited. We should have a delicate balance between the 2 tradeoffs. For small interactivity websites? Yes they are good,
for larger websites? NO.

## Conclusion

Although everyone likes to trash on Web Components, I think they are pretty OK. (Yea I have also kind of spread hate about it sometimes)
They are a convenient feature for adding component-based interactive islands with vanilla JavaScript, but not something I would use all the time.
